This project has been discontinued with the end of Modded Minecraft 1.9. Thanks for the fun!


Note:
* Please report 1.9.0 issues in THIS repository, NOT at pixlepix's or the 1.8.9 repository by Williewillus
* Do not ask for design changes, I will strictly match the design of upstream.
* This fork, like the mod itself, is licensed under the [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) and the parts drawn from Botania under the [Botania license](http://botaniamod.net/license.php).
* Do not ask for an ETA, it is always "ASAP."
